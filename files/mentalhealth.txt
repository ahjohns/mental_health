in
last
semester
my
graduate
degree
i
suffered
from
emotional
breakdown
term
not
medical
term
nor
officially
recognized
by
mental
health
professionals;
my
own
therapist
i
have
struggled
find
concise
word
describes
my
experience
laypersons
through
discussion
we
have
found
this
one
acceptable
despite
my
experience
being
nuanced
layered
with
complications
overarchingly
though
term
emotional
breakdown
used
describe
acute
severe
anxiety
depression
develops
formerly
functional
individual
caused
by
stress
related
event
one’s
life
it
can
manifest
with
similar
symptoms
acute
stages
post
traumatic
stress
disorder
leave
person
unable
function
properly
until
they
recover
mental
health
crisis
it’s
debilitating
confusing
dangerous
without
proper
treatment
care
inner
understanding
my
own
experience
not
why
i
am
articulating
these
words
here
today
real
reason
i
write
these
words
because
what
i
experienced
after
i
had
rebuilt
myself
recovered
wake
incredibly
significant
tumultuous
time
my
own
life:
experience
moving
forward
speaking
openly
unfortunately
having
defend
myself
wake
miscommunications
other
people’s
misperceptions
my
own
status
it’s
these
experiences
have
had
most
profound
impact
me
catalyst
which
based
feelings
being
put
position
where
i
had
defend
myself
way
no
person
should
have
ever
receiving
wake
up
call
fully
understand
accept
severity
what
i
had
gone
through
recognize
hard
work
i
had
done
overcome
i
put
into
position
not
just
by
anyone
by
friend
good
person
with
responsibility
creating
those
stressors
caused
my
own
crisis
begin
with
it’s
complicated
story
one
i’m
comfortable
with
end
honestly
mostly
quite
grateful
someone
turning
30
years
old
this
year
i’ve
gained
lot
perspective
very
relatively
short
period
time
ended
up
only
being
positive
every
sense
word
first
foremost
i’d
like
note
i
do
have
generalized
anxiety
disorder
never
going
go
away
while
it
has
contributed
severity
my
experience
managing
disorder
has
effectively
allowed
me
create
tools
be
successful
my
recovery
it
never
underlying
problem
why
experience
existed
first
place
prior
couple
months
before
my
28th
birthday
i
had
been
functional
adult
silently
managing
my
own
most
my
cognizant
life
my
parents
have
often
referred
me
“worrier”
like
many
people
with
these
types
disorders
real
problems
arise
boil
underneath
surface
often
going
untreated
i
very
fortunate
enough
meet
lovely
young
woman
very
good
friend
mine
who
suggested
therapy
i
got
touch
with
cognitive
behavior
therapist
my
area
first
time
my
life
i
went
get
treatment
i
nervous
bit
uncomfortable
about
having
go
see
specialist
uncertain
about
what
would
be
outcome
after
first
appointment
i
felt
liberated
excited
be
finally
dealing
with
my
problems
head
all
during
my
second
year
completing
intensive
graduate
degree
program
unfortunately
me
i
also
living
with
friend
mine
she
knew
about
my
anxiety
issues
i
had
begun
see
therapist
which
can
be
precarious
anyone
at
first
go
however
she
going
through
some
problems
her
own
sharing
space
with
someone
else
if
things
had
played
out
differently
they
did
i
probably
would
have
adjusted
quickly
successfully
my
new
found
sense
liberation
from
my
long
standing
anxiety
issues
things
did
begin
play
out
during
first
month
two
living
together
she
rather
negligently
unempathetically
passive
aggressively
projected
her
negative
feelings
onto
me
while
treating
apartment
her
own
myself
like
stranger
neither
she
nor
i
could
have
known
what
kind
harm
negative
impact
my
own
life
those
actions
would
end
up
having
buildup
part
turning
point
leading
beginning
my
own
crisis
not
only
did
this
projection
succeed
albeit
unintentionally
she
created
hostile
unsafe
toxic
environment
making
me
afraid
her
being
apartment
itself
byproduct
set
triggers
still
haunt
me
this
day
being
afraid
friend
who
you
care
my
opinion
saddest
thing
about
my
experience
always
will
be
she
would
end
up
leaving
abruptly
insensitively
which
associated
further
bad
memories
physical
space
my
living
arrangement
with
all
this
lack
self-awareness
her
part
i
ultimately
concerned
about
her
her
behavior
not
myself
i
didn’t
realize
what
our
apartment
would
end
up
doing
me
psychologically
understand
what
i
experiencing
with
her
behavior
would
be
traumatic
extremely
stressful
my
own
day
day
functioning
life
it
turned
out
it
too
much
me
reflecting
back
i
believe
i
showed
many
warning
signs
someone
about
break
down
i’m
not
entirely
sure
what
could
have
been
done
correct
things
before
they
started
i
know
i
partly
needed
other
person
show
consideration
empathy
sensitivity
purely
psychological
behaviors
actions
have
purely
psychological
consequences
struggle
over
articulating
her
after
i
recovered
well
her
own
responsibility
creation
something
would
later
bring
about
reason
why
these
words
are
being
written
today
i’d
prefer
keep
details
months
living
environment
another
time
place
i
will
say
living
apartment
afterwards
alone
unbeknownst
most
people
i
actually
danger
myself
subconsciously
i
knew
i
dealt
with
it
best
way
i
could
if
i
hadn’t
had
support
my
therapist
few
very
close
confidants
even
they
probably
didn’t
understand
how
severe
it
at
time
i’m
not
sure
where
i’d
be
i
never
suicidal
there
were
moments
where
i
knew
how
i
coping
would
end
up
doing
me
lot
self-harm
i
under
distress
like
most
people
going
through
mental
health
crisis
such
my
own
i
unable
accurately
pinpoint
why
i
felt
way
i
did
until
i
able
start
resolving
my
situation
independently
those
who
were
exposed
distress
state
mind
know
how
i
portrayed
myself
outwardly
both
confusing
ambiguous
i
apologize
them
honestly
one
person
who
exposed
most
my
friend
former
roommate
herself
there
time
period
last
spring
where
i
sent
lot
uncomfortable
noise
her
i
take
full
responsibility
my
behavior
especially
now
having
full
perspective
over
why
behavior
existed
even
if
i
not
actually
aware
how
manifestations
my
mental
duress
were
being
perceived
lot
it
can
be
contributed
me
living
sleeping
environment
one
my
outside
stressors
triggers
i
did
not
have
ability
process
real
emotion
thought
process
effectively
it
very
distressing
dangerous
it
took
long
time
resolve
my
own
through
time
effort
lot
perspective
gaining
enough
self
respect
be
open
about
what
happened
me
one
cognizant
choices
i
made
stay
away
from
apartment
during
day
coming
home
at
night
which
caused
me
anxiety
panic
insomnia
around
april
i
started
see
success
cognitive
behavior
therapy
which
cleared
up
some
fog
start
thinking
effectively
may
i
started
taking
ssri
i
still
am
medication
year
later
plan
continue
be
some
time
i
sleep
well
i
dream
vividly
anxiety/depression
management
tool
it
works
wonders
which
further
helped
me
recover
however
be
able
process
emotions
express
them
all
at
once
proved
be
distressing
flow
information
i
did
not
yet
have
mindset
be
more
thoughtful
about
what
still
very
delicate
complicated
sensitive
issue
think
about
how
people
react
sudden
floods
threaten
their
well-being
transplant
into
conscious
reality
it
can
be
overwhelming
expressions
this
distress
manifested
tones
wavered
intensity
person
whom
through
process
working
through
this
sudden
flood
information
i
discovered
had
responsibility
matter
i
upset
knew
lot
things
has
happened
previous
few
months
which
made
her
distance
herself
from
me
her
former
residence
my
friend
course
deserves
biggest
apology
out
everyone
receiving
noise
truthfully
i
have
tried
communicate
very
supportive
positive
viewpoint
not
only
her
others
well
i
know
one
person’s
comfort
another
person’s
discomfort
we
all
have
eventually
face
horrible
things
with
open
embracing
mind
it
takes
time
perspective
adjust
it
well
worth
it
at
some
point
process
during
my
recovery
i
made
conscious
informed
decision
keeping
this
all
myself
not
sharing
some
incredibly
fundamental
things
about
my
life
would
end
up
being
harmful
delay
sort
attempts
move
past
previous
troubles
anxieties
i
also
wanted
go
through
effort
speak
my
friend
personally
order
come
some
sort
understanding
mostly
out
respect
her
essentially
i
wanted
hold
her
accountable
let
her
know
i
wanted
express
myself
way
move
forward
from
what
had
at
point
been
awful
experience
knowing
something
harmful
having
loyalty
friend
who
negatively
impacted
me
i
believe
i
largely
never
expressed
full
severity
her
up
until
point
way
protect
her
regardless
it
during
summer
i
started
asking
meet
with
her
slowly
intensely
revealing
damage
she
had
done
i
under
impression
revelations
responsibility
over
harming
someone
would
be
upsetting
hard
take
if
she
were
thinking
about
this
at
all
despite
being
willing
give
her
time
effectively
process
her
own
like
i
had
i
remained
desperate
move
forward
with
my
decision
waiting
around
her
caused
me
some
distress
i
could
not
have
known
her
viewpoint
me
at
point
time
would
be
so
fractured
she
would
have
perspective
she
ended
up
having
my
perspective
at
this
point
time
whatever
distance
she
created
her
own
had
made
it
difficult
bridge
gap
communication
especially
my
tone
uncomfortably
erratic
with
my
own
distress
feeling
overwhelmed
with
information
from
my
understanding
she
unwilling
listen
words
i
trying
say
thought
i
someone
need
help
support
not
someone
control
under
perception
she
spoke
out
anger
frustration
at
point
i
realized
we
were
never
same
page
my
efforts
speak
her
seemed
rather
pointless
i
called
unwell
linked
our
regional
stalking
law
this
at
time
seemed
more
hurtful
me
other
thing
had
happened
so
far
honestly
i
understand
how
perspective
had
developed
it
absolutely
devastating
be
judged
such
fundamental
level
i
think
just
things
had
become
overwhelming
me
things
had
become
overwhelming
her
too
my
interpretation
her
behavior/actions
she
accusing
me
stalking
her
psychologically
i
unwell
enough
not
be
aware
what
i
doing
i
felt
at
very
moment
this
person
whom
i
called
friend
wanted
speak
had
developed
fractured
viewpoint
me
i
very
much
hurt
also
honestly
very
angry
i
believed
she
calling
me
crazy
thought
i
delusional
my
initial
reaction
this
based
purely
off
emotion
anxiety
i
tried
figure
out
ways
defend
myself
legally
i
think
gravitas
these
actions
were
major
game-changers
me
began
subtly
change
my
confidence
level
my
commitment
opening
up
about
my
own
experience
my
emotional
breakdown
personal
injury
thankfully
i
had
recovered
incredibly
proud
my
success
i
would
course
never
have
sued
her
her
responsibility
i
felt
like
act
finality
only
option
left
me
fortunately
we
ended
up
meeting
seeing
each
other
first
time
6
months
i’m
not
sure
what
she
thought
after
seeing
me
person
i
think
this
first
time
my
friend
truly
started
listen
both
us
are
equally
responsible
things
escalating
they
did
i’ve
alluded
it
previously
i’ve
processed
those
escalations
enough
understand
this
point
where
i
started
develop
mindset
i
currently
have
now
it’s
heavy
consider
suing
someone
you
care
respect
it’s
heavy
feel
like
you
have
defend
your
mental
health
someone
seemingly
with
opposite
opinion
reality
things
those
acts
brought
me
better
understanding
just
what
exactly
had
happened
me
allowed
me
have
courage
embrace
my
experience
what
it
it’s
been
influential
my
own
philosophy
openness
i
try
push
myself
further
every
day
all
fairness
her
my
friend
wonderful
person
i
made
some
misfires
trying
communicate
with
her
under
duress
i
could
write
entire
separate
article
about
her
vices
virtues
i
suspect
it
would
be
overwhelmingly
positive
what
i
am
trying
say
while
i
bear
no
negative
feelings
about
what
i
experienced
last
year
towards
her
i
respect
reason
i
am
writing
this
now
because
those
series
unfortunate
events
i
understand
if
i
had
not
been
put
position
defend
status
my
own
mental
health
someone
with
very
different
fractured
opinion
i
would
not
have
courage
confidence
commitment
be
writing
this
article
today
most
important
thing
someone
who
has
experienced
mental
health
crisis
can
do
speak
palatably
about
their
struggles
my
opinion
final
step
recovery
success:
taking
ownership
why
how
we
feel
way
we
do/have
be
comfortable
speaking
openly
about
that — to
not
try
forget
erase
past;
forgive
embrace
accept
personally
grow
exploring
deeply
personal
private
matter
has
honestly
been
one
happiest
things
i’ve
done
myself
making
ourselves
vulnerable
human
ability
absolutely
frightening
difficult
doing
so
we
gain
better
understanding
ourselves
world
around
us
we
gain
sense
respect
knowledge
has
no
comparison
from
more
deeper
philosophical
level
it
risk
world
stigmatizes
people
who
have
anxiety
depression
other
mental
illness
i
believe
empowerment
understanding
arises
within
oneself
makes
it
very
much
worth
it
i
value
respect
anyone
who
has
it
within
themselves
do
same
being
said
it
perhaps
hypocritical
posting
this
anonymously
i’ve
chosen
do
so
order
protect
myself
my
friend
outside
our
own
circles
i
do
have
be
careful
stigma
unfortunate
reality
things
i
am
well
aware
this
i
can
only
speak
my
own
experience
which
very
complicated
nuanced
still
rather
sensitive
i
suspect
taking
ownership
over
my
own
hard
work
having
respect
both
my
friend
myself
accepting
this
something
transient
yet
unequivocally
life
altering
has
empowered
me
highly
positive
way
i’m
comfortable
facing
this
happened
facing
truth
why
this
happened
i
know
there
another
person
involved
who
may
not
be
same
opinion
currently
have
same
mindset
me
i’ve
considered
every
step
way
