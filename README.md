# mental_health
Use this code to explore your own personal writing. I think it's useful to explore perspective from multiple angles. Figuring out the frequency through use of a word cloud tells a lot about what you're thinking when you are writing something that is based on experience and human emotions.

##prerequisites
Use pip to install the matplotlib module package.
If you are using an OSX environment, I'd recommend installing Homebrew first, follow instructions for that here: http://brew.sh
```
brew install python
sudo pip install matplotlib
```
To get the word cloud package up and running, follow the command line instructions here: https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud
Beware to take note of special note about file-names for non-ubuntu environments.

##Get your repository set up
```
git clone https://github.com/ahjohns/mental_health
cd mental_health
```
Whatever personal writing you want to explore, it needs to be in a txt file. You need to edit the .py files where appropriate.
