# mental_health
Use this code to explore your own personal writing describing experiences.

##prerequisites
Use pip to install the matplotlib module package
If you are using an OSX environment, I'd recommend installing Homebrew first to install a separate contingency of python, follow instructions for that here: http://brew.sh
```
brew install python
sudo pip install matplotlib
```
To get the word cloud package up and running, follow the command line instructions here: https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud
Beware of the non-ubuntu instructions.
Get your repository set up
```
git clone https://github.com/ahjohns/mental_health
cd mental_health
```
Whatever personal writing you want to explore, it needs to be in a txt file. You need to edit the .py files with the appropriate file naming.
